# Write a program to check whether a number is palindrome or not.Note: A palindrome is a sequence of characters (or numbers) that reads the same 
# forwards as it does backwards. In other words, it remains unchanged when reversed.Test Case1:Input:242 Output:YesTest Case2:Input:1351,Output:No

# a=int(input('enter the number'))
# o=a
# r=0
# while a>0:
#     r=(r*10)+a%10
#     a=a//10
# if r==o:
#     print('yes')
# else:
#     print('no')
