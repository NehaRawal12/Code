# Write a program to take a year from the user and output whether a given year is a leap year or not.
# Note: A year is said to be a leap year if it is either divisible by 400 or it should be divisible by 4 and not by 100.
# Test Case1:Input:1800,Output:No,Test Case2:Input:2000,Output:Yes

# a=int(input('enter the number'))
# if a%400==0 or  a%4==0 and a%100!=0:
#     print('leap year yes')
# else:
#     print('no')
