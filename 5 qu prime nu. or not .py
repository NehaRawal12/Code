# write a program to check if a number is a special type of number called a 'prime number'. A prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself, and it doesn't have any other factors. 
# For example, the number 7 is a prime number because it can only be divided by 1 and 7 without leaving a remainder. However, the number 12 is not a prime number because it has other factors, such as 2, 3, 4, and 6, in addition to 1 and 12. (Take the number from the user)?Test Case1:Input:97,Output:Yes .Test Case2:Input:49,Output:No


# a=int(input('enter the number'))
# c=0
# i=1
# while i<=a:
#     if a%i==0:
#         c=c+1
#     i=i+1
# if c==2:
#     print('yes')
# else:
#     print('no')
